dnv_scraper
===========

Scraper for argentinian National Roads Department (DNV in spanish) traffic
information.

It is used to scrape traffic data from the site of "Direcci√≥n Nacional de
Vialidad" wich is the national roads department authority in Argentina:
http://transito.vialidad.gov.ar:8080/SelCE_WEB/intro.html

I am currently heavy-refactoring and translating into english lots of old pieces
of code from my scratch starts as a self-taught programmer, so this one it's
still not able for human consumption :)  (althought it works)

I hope to prettify it soon.
